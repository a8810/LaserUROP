  Reads an analog input on pin 0, prints the result to the serial monitor.
  Graphical representation is available using serial plotter (Tools > Serial Plotter menu)
  Attach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A0, and the outside pins to +5V and ground.

/*
  Consider these factors when using the Arduino as an ADC:
  - What is the sampling rate of the analog signal, and does it satisfy the Nyquist rate (is this even relevant)?
  - Is the scale linear? Does the output require calibration to a given voltage analogue input?
  - Degree of quantisation error?
  - Level of noise?
  - Repeated averaging of ADC values to reduce error.
  - How should the comms request a certain number of measurements?

// take N measurements with a sample rate of R, return bit rate, current model number, firmware info, connected pins, return done when a command is done
